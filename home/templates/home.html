The African Redemptive Struggle Museum
An Igala Kingdom USA Enterprise

The ARS museum once, known as the Gullah Heritage Museum, 
is America’s first anti-slavery resistance museum dedicated 
to the African-American quest for freedom from 1526 to 1858. 
It houses the largest selection of anti-slavery resistance 
art in America.

ARS Museum is 100% owned and operated by descendants of “self 
liberated Africans” (a.k.a. maroons) and house in the historic 
Independent African Methodist Episcopal Church founded in 1898.

Come be inspired by the masterful paintings of the people and 
events that shaped early American history
